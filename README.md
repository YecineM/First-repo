Hey,
This repository is my first one on GitHub.
I code in Python, but I also have made many projects using Selenium IDE.
I like Javascript, but I'm a total beginner in it.

I will deposit some Python code bits I have written on SoloLearn.
I hope you like them.

So, 

***about me***

    1- Name:   Yecine (pronounced Yeseen)
    2- Gender: male
            
    I'm a pharmacy student, but I like coding.
    I love maths too.
    I recently fell in love with history..
    I think I'll have to give up one my hobbies,
    It's just too much.
    
See what I'm doing here ?
1. I introduced myself.
2. I used markdown syntax, and it worked !!
